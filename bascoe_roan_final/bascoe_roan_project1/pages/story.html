      <p>
        Final Fantasy X follows the story of Tidus, a star blitzball player with
        the Zanarkand Abes. One fateful night, while playing in a blitzball
        match, Tidus' world is shattered when a supernatural monstrous entity
        known as "Sin" attacks Zanarkand. Amid the destruction, Tidus crosses
        paths with Auron, a friend of Tidus' father Jecht, whom Tidus had known
        during his childhood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Auron gives Tidus a sword and instructs him to combat the monsters,
        referred to as "fiends," that are spawned by Sin. While Tidus and Auron
        engage these fiends, their world starts to be drawn closer to Sin. As
        they approach Sin, Auron seemingly communicates with it. He then turns
        to Tidus and says, "This is your story." Tidus is seemingly absorbed by
        Sin and is mysteriously transported 1,000 years into the future to the
        world of Spira, where his journey begins.
