      <blockquote>
        "Everyone has lost something precious. Everyone here has lost homes,
        dreams, and friends. Everybody! Now, Sin is finally dead. Now, Spira is
        ours again. Working together, now we can make new homes for ourselves,
        and new dreams. Although I know the journey will be hard, we have lots
        of time. Together, we will rebuild Spira. The road is ahead of us, so
        let's start out today. Just, one more thing... the people and the
        friends that we have lost, or the dreams that have faded... Never forget
        them." - Yuna
