      <p>
        Final Fantasy X uses a Conditional Turn-Based Battle (CTB) system. While
        this system still requires strategy to defeat your opponents without
        giving them more opportinities to defeat you, you don't have to worry
        about being rushed since there is no timer for how fast you have to make
        a decision. Certain characters get more turns based on their agility and
        by the use of spells or abilites, such as Haste.

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Sphere Grid System</h2>
      <p>
        Players use the Sphere Gris system to grow the characters in their
        party. After each successful battle, your characters gain abilty points
        and different types of spheres. Players then use these to enhance their
        characters abilites in areas such as attacks skills, defense skills,
        black magic, and white magic.

      <p>
        The story of Final Fantasy X has two reoccuring enemies throughout the
        story. These enemies are Sin, the final boss, and Maester Seymour Guado,
        a deranged influential figure in Spira that uses his power for his own
        sinister ends.
